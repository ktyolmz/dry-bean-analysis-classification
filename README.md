The dataset for his project is the [Dry Bean](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset) dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). 
It is a popular dataset used in machine learning and statistical analysis. 
It contains information about 7 diffrent (Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermason, Horoz, Seker and Sira) dry bean and 13611 instances.
A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms. 
The main objective of this project is to construct a model that accurately predicts the category of the dry bean based on the given features.
